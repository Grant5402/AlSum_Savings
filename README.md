# Personal Budgeting and Finance Management System

## **Project Description**
This project is a **Personal Budgeting and Finance Management System** built in C++ using **wxWidgets** for the graphical user interface. The system demonstrates a practical application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It allows users to manage their finances efficiently by creating envelopes, tracking expenses, and analyzing transactions.

This project was developed as part of an independent study course **CMSC 391**, focused on mastering OOP concepts in C++.
